\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Background}
There have been efforts to streamline delivery of authentic information about students who attend higher institutions of learning. \\~\\
In a bid to achieve this, Makerere University, like any other institutions, uses a conventional online system to manage students' results. Upon admission to the university, an account is opened for each student through which they can can view their progressive academic records which are uploaded by a centralized administration that comprises of the school registrars. For security purposes, users are required to enter credentials i.e Student Number / Registration Number and Password. Through this, only authentic users can access the system. The use of this online system has eased students' access to their records as opposed to the formally crowded notice boards where results were pinned. For purposes of security, the system runs on the university's intranet network. However, the limitation to this is that access to information is only possible through connection to the intranet. Another downside is that the system is still prone to manipulation by unauthorized users.\\\\
Recently one of the breakthroughs in technology has been the management of records belonging to a group of people using a decentralized system. One may wonder how this is possible. Well, this is done using a technology known as blockchain.\\\\
A blockchain is a growing list of records which are linked using cryptography\cite{art2}. Blockchain can not only be used to store records, but also be used for their secure manipulation. By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of the data stored on it. It is "an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way".\\\\
In the context of Makerere University, blockchain technology would be a good alternative to the conventional online system that was meantioned before. Both options can effectively store students results. However using blockchain guarantees one some extra features that would better the management of students records. For example \cite{art3} :\\\\
Transparency – Both parties who are interested in viewing academic credentials can see them on the  blockchain. This ensures that only people with ownership rights can make decisions about who has access to particular information.\\\\
Immutability – Blockchains are the most secure source for storing the information right now. They rely on the integrity of the network to ensure the authenticity of the stored information. Thus, academic certificates stored on the blockchain are immutable.\\\\
Disintermediation - Using the blockchain to store and share academic credentials helps us bypass the need for a central controlling authority that manages and keeps records. This makes the overall process of storing credentials more trustworthy as there are no middlemen involved.\\\\
Collaboration – Once the information becomes available on the blockchain, it is much easier to ascribe ownership, and therefore safer to share the information without the fear of this information being compromised.\\\\
In this project, we intend to build a blockchain application that will aid the management of students' records at Makerere University. 




\section{Problem Statement}
With focus on Makerere University, the problem of authenticity of academic transcripts is majorly caused by the level of security of the current results management system which gives room to unauthorized access and manipulation of results. This is of course done by persons with advanced knowledge on how to access such systems and bypass the security. Besides the mentioned weakness about the system, there is a lot of paperwork and bureaucracy involved in the issuance of academic documents as this is still done manually within the various University offices. This causes a lot of delay in acquiring these documents and opens channels for corruption. This project aims at tackling the above-mentioned shortcomings with a focus on the results testimonial issued to a student of the university.

\section{Main Objective}
The overall aim of this project is to improve authenticity of documents by implementing block chain technology.
\subsection{Specific Objectives}
The specific objectives of the study were: 
\begin{itemize}
\item To de-materialize academic documents. Unlike paper-based records that can easily get lost, once put in block chain, the students' grades will be safe.
\item To reduce the need for a third-party controlling authority that manages and keeps students' records.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Scope}

The challenges mentioned in the problem statement above are broad and cut across a number of institutions of higher learning in the nation and even beyond borders. For this project however, the focus will be on Makerere University Main Campus located in Kampala, Uganda. Furthermore, the project will focus on issuance of the academic transcript issued to a student of the university among other documents.

\subsection{Significance}

No one would like to eat half baked bread leave alone the raw dough. The employment industry is flooded with so many employees that have barely attained the knowledge to perform the tasks they are given simply because they were able to manipulate their results and convince their employer that they’re capable. \\ \\
This project is aimed at closing such loop holes that allow people manipulate their results. This would allow an employer attain all the necessary information about his/her employees as all the information will appear on a block chain network. \\ \\
Besides authentic results, the load of paperwork will be cut by a great deal. This is the documents shall be issued electronically as opposed to manual issuance. Generally, this would ease records keeping and reduce the work currently involved. \\ \\
For employers, block chain technology will avoid them having to spend valuable time checking candidates' educational credentials by having to call universities or to pay a third party to do the job. \\ \\
By authenticity of academic records, Makerere University will exist in accordance to its values and reflect these values. Through this, the university will embrace the added responsibility of leading by example not only as the best university in Uganda, but also to the worldwide community of institutions of higher learning. \\
