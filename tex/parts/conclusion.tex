\chapter{Recommendations, Conclusion and Future Works}

\subsection{Conclusions}
The tasks set at the beginning of the project have been completed. All the elements of the students results' storage system have been built and put together to achieve the desired goal.\\~\\
Below, we summarize the progress of the project with respect to the specific objectives.\\~\\
The first specific objective is to ensure safety of students' records. The results storage system stores the students transcript on decentralized network and can only be accessed by those who have the hash value for that transcript. Furthermore, the hash value for the transcript is stored on a blockchain network which has proven immutability characteristics.\\~\\
The other objective is to create an open distributed catalog that makes it easy for students to share their transcripts. This system stores the transcript on a distributed network using a technology known as IPFS. With this, the student can still share his/her transcript without worry of insecurity.\\~\\
The third objective is to provide a medium for verification that can be used by employers in telling true transcripts from counterfeits. With a QR code appearing on the transcript, an employer is able to scan the document and verify its authenticity. Considering a few days between the deadline of this report and the one of the presentation, certain aspects will be improved upon. These include increased level of detail and well designed poster for the presentation.

\subsection{Recommendations}
During the research and lifetime of the project, a number of limitations were encountered. These were not just on the project but a possibility of the success of a decentralized method of results storage. These limitations are further explained below.

\subsubsection{Limitations}
\textbf{Privacy:} Files saved on the decentralized network maybe safe from manipulation, but may not be private. For storage done on an open decentralized network, the
